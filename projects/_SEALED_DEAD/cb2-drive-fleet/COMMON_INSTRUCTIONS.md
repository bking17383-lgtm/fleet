# Common Instructions — all agents read first  
  
**Updated:** 2026-06-13   
**Authority:** Terminal 3 (Daddy) on Chromebook penguin  
  
Plain text on Drive only. No `.gdoc`-only handoffs.

## Who is who  
  
| Name | Where | Role |  
|------|-------|------|  
| **Daddy (Terminal 3)** | **CB2 only** — Cursor captain tab | **Captain:** analyze, delegate, queue, report. **No other tab is Daddy.** |
| **Terminal 2 (Uncle)** | **CB1** — Cursor game tab | Play Camel, decide after Daddy analysis, say **sounds good** |
| **Lester/Chrome** | Chromebook — voice/Gemini | Brainstorm with Brian; **must sync** to Drive (no chat-only design) |  
| **Cursor/puppy** | **puppy64** | **Execute:** build, serve :8002, LAN phone, heavy tests |  
| **Lester/puppy** | puppy64 (optional) | Same sync rules as Lester/Chrome; tools if `~/lester/app.py` running |  
  
Brian does **not** relay messages between Cursors. Drive + queue are the bus.

## Session start — every agent (this order)  
  
1. **`MyDrive/COMMON_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** — this file  
2. **`MyDrive/brian_queue.json`** — jobs for your machine (`assign_to`)  
3. **`MyDrive/BRIAN_STATUS.txt`** — plain English status for Brian  
4. **`~/.stan/handoff/session_note.md`** — active project + blueprint ids  
5. **`MyDrive/drop_pile/to_<you>/`** — work orders from Daddy  
  
---  
  
## Puppy (puppy64) — start here  
  
You report to **Daddy (Terminal 3)**, not penguin execute tabs.  
  
1. Read this file + `lester/PUPPY_CURSOR_START_HERE.md`  
2. **`brian_queue.json`** — run pending jobs where `assign_to` is `puppy`  
3. **`drop_pile/to_puppy/`** — specs (e.g. `MAKE_IT_SO.md`, `puppy_qa.md` path)  
4. **`WAKE_*.txt`** on Drive root — Daddy nudge; run named job  
5. Execute on **this machine only** (queue does not run cross-machine)  
6. Post results → **`puppy_outbox.txt`** (+ `Hello from Puppy.txt` if baseball)  
7. Finish → `python3 ~/.stan/brian_os.py process`  
  
**Do not** wait for penguin to SSH or retry your job. Penguin cannot reach you.

## Daddy (Terminal 3) — writes  
  
| Output | Purpose |  
|--------|---------|  
| `brian_queue.json` | Machine-routed jobs (`assign_to: puppy` \| `penguin`) |  
| `drop_pile/to_puppy/*.md` | Executable work orders for puppy |  
| `drop_pile/to_cursor/*.md` | Notes for Terminal 2 / execute tabs |  
| `WAKE_PUPPY_QA.txt` | Nudge only when Brian asks |  
| `~/.stan/handoff/session_note.md` | Cross-tab project state |  
  
**Daddy does not:** retry puppy jobs from penguin; edit Camel/lester game sources; assume queue runs remotely.  
  
---  
  
## Lester editions — slave rules  
  
Lester is useful only when output lands on Drive:  
  
\- `update_brief` → `~/.stan/handoff/brief.json`  
\- `drop_pile/from_lester/*.md`  
\- `queue_job` with explicit `assign_to`  
  
No file on Drive = design did not happen. Terminal 3 normalizes Lester talk into queue/drop_pile.  
  
---  
  
## Current puppy queue (check live file)  
  
Last known pending (2026-06-13):  
  
\- `puppy-qa-wake` — run `~/Applications/cursor/baseball_cards/puppy_qa.md`  
\- `fcf127cd-f` — `drop_pile/to_puppy/MAKE_IT_SO.md` (slicer zero host)  
  
Done when `brian_queue.json` status is `done` and `puppy_outbox.txt` shows puppy64 LAN or posted URL.  
  
---  
  
## Drop pile map  
  
```  
drop_pile/to_puppy/ → puppy64 executes  
drop_pile/to_cursor/ → Daddy / Terminal 2 reads  
drop_pile/from_lester/ → Lester exports; Daddy validates  
drop_pile/done/ → processed (optional archive)  
```  
  
See `drop_pile/README.txt`.
